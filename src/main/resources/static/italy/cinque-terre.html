    <p> We got to Cinque Terre and our mouths dropped. They had breath taking views. 
        There were onl three ways to travel in between the cities. First was hiking 
        the Cinque Terre Trail. Second was the Boat Taxis and last the was the train.
        We highly recommend the hike. </p>
