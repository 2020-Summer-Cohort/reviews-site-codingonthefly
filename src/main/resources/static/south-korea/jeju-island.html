             <p>Points of Interest: Jungmun Lava Columns, Museum of Glass</p>   
              <h2>Jungmun Lava Columns</h2>    
              <p>    These columns are located near the Mangnan Lava Tubes. 
                  They are formed by    volcanic lava being cooled by the ocean water, 
                  naturally taking the    striking column shape. They also have "Black 
                  Sand Beaches" nearby, which    are beachfronts that have black sand, 
                  instead of the usual tan.    </p>    <h2>Museum of Glass</h2>    
                  <p>    The Museum of Glass is exactly what it sounds like. It is a 
                      museum that    houses thousands of blown glass art pieces. Some 
                      reference old tales like    jack and the bean stalk, while others
                       reference Cinderella. Largely most    of them are scenic views, 
                       like trees and flowers.    </p>
