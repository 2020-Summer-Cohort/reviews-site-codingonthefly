    <h1>Florence Review</h1>
    <p>Star Rating: 3 / 5</p>
    <p>Points of Interest: 
        <ul>
            <li>Galleria dell'Accademia</li>
            <li>Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p> The city was full of tourist and students. The Galleria dell'Accademia housed 
        the Statue of David, which was impressive, but the security team does not allow photos.
        this is very upsetting to most travelers. During our visit the Cathedral of Santa Maria del 
        Fiore was hosting a festival that filled the streets. The celebration was fun, but there 
        are a few safety concerns with pick pickpockets. Be sure to keep your belongings safe.
