    <p> The city was full of tourist and students. The Galleria dell'Accademia housed 
        the Statue of David was impressive, but the security team does not allow photos.
        During our visit the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore was hosting a festival 
        that filled the streets. We wont go back for more than a night if we return. </p>
