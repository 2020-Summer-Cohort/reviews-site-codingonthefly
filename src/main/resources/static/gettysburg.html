    National Military Park”>
    <p>
      Rated number one on things to do in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, this
      historic military landmark was once a major turning point in the Civil
      War. Thought to have been one of the bloodiest battles during the Civil
      War, this was also a pivotal moment in history that gave inspiration for
      Abraham Lincoln’s “Gettysburg Address”. Many locals say that this landmark
      is also extremely haunted.

    Course”>
    <p>
      For anyone who is an avid golfer, this links-style course presents a
      demanding layout with unforgiving fairways and greens, as well as various
      steep rock cliffs, lakes, and waterfalls spanning across its 18 holes. At
      a length of 7069 yards, this par-72 course is one of the larger public
      courses in the area, making it a challenge for some golfers off the tee.
      After the turn, or at the end of your round, The Links At Gettysburg also
      has a spacious indoor/outdoor bar with great food and beverages.
