    <h1>Jeju Island Review</h1>
    <p>Star Rating: 5 / 5</p>
    <p>Points of Interest: Jungmun Lava Columns, Museum of Glass</p>
    <h2>Jungmun Lava Columns</h2>
    <p>
      These columns are located near the Mangnan Lava Tubes. They are formed by
      volcanic lava being cooled by the ocean water, naturally taking the
      striking column shape. They also have "Black Sand Beaches" nearby, which
      are beach fronts that have black sand, instead of the usual tan.
   
      The Museum of Glass is exactly what it sounds like. It is a museum that
      houses thousands of blown glass art pieces. Some reference old tales like
      jack and the bean stalk, while others reference Cinderella. Largely most
      of them are scenic views, like trees and flowers. <a href="./ocean-view.html">
