    <h1>Lucaya Review</h1>
    <p>Star Rating: Also a 4</p>
    <p>
      Points of Interest: Here is what to do in Lucaya. Count Basie Square,
      Leo's Art Gallery, and Neptune's Cocktail Lounge are just to name a few.
      O, you can't forget Pelican Bay

      Tony L: I still haven't figured out how you can be on what seems like the
      top of a mountain and on the beach at the same time. Everything here seems
      perfect. You can't go wrong and the Marina is just at the bottom of the
      drive
