    <h2>Gettysburg National Military Park</h2>
    <p>Rated number one on things to do in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 
        this historic military landmark was once a major turning point 
        in the Civil War. Thought to have been one of the bloodiest battles during
        the Civil War, this was also a pivotal moment in history that gave
        inspiration for Abraham Lincoln's "Gettysburg Address". Many locals say that
        this landmark is also extremely haunted.
