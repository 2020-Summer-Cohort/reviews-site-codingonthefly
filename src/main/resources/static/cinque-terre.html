    <p> We got to Cinque Terre and our mouths dropped. It had breath taking views. 
        We stumbled on the Cinque Terre Trail after finding that there were three 
        ways to travel in between the cities. We ended up taking the hike. It was worth it.
        Our taxi drivers name was Luca. He said we would make it to the city next door
        before the rain. We didn't make it... Very upset about our clothes being wet 
        for dinner. <a href="./park.html">#Park</a> <a href="./active.html"> #Active</a>
