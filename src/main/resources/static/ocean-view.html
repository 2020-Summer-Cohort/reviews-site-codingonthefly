    <h2>Jeju Island Review</h2>
    <p>
      The Jungman Lava Columns are located near the Mangnan Lava Tubes. They are formed by
      volcanic lava being cooled by the ocean water, naturally taking the
      striking column shape. They also have "Black Sand Beaches" nearby, which
      are beachfronts that have black sand, instead of the usual tan.

    <h2>Lucaya Review</h2>
    <p>
      Points of Interest: Here is what to do in Lucaya. Count Basie Square,
      Leo's Art Gallery, and Neptune's Cocktail Lounge are just to name a few.
      O, you can't forget Pelican Bay
    </p>

      Tony L: I still haven't figured out how you can be on what seems like the
      top of a mountain and on the beach at the same time. Everything here seems
      perfect. You can't go wrong and the Marina is just at the bottom of the
      drive

    <h2>Miami, Florida</h2>
    <h2>Vizcaya Museum and Gardens</h2>
    <p>
      A historical Italian estate first built in 1916 as a private winter
      retreat for American Businessman James Deering, this beautiful villa pays
      tribute to the Italian Renaissance era. On this site tourists can visit a
      Museum that still has its earlier furnishings and artwork intact, as well
      as its beautiful formal gardens. Many tourists say this is one of the best
      bay views in Miami!

    <h2>Wynwood Walls</h2>
    <p>
      Open to the public, and free of charge! Doesn’t get any better than that.
      Wynwood Walls was first established and opened in 2009 by well-known art
      visionary Tony Goldman. This outdoor museum features more than 40 street
      art murals from some of the leading street artists around the world. If
      you’re an up-and-coming artist looking for inspiration, this place is a
      must see! </p>

      <h2>Nassau Review</h2>
      <p>Star Rating: 4</p>
      <p>
        Points of Interest: Nassaus is known for quite a few attractions,
        including Cable Beach, Blue Lagoon Island, Queen's Staircase, Clifton
        Heritage National Park, and my favorite, the Aquaventure water park.

        James H: "OMG, Beautiful water, nice people, great culture. I am coming
        back tomorrow, lol."
