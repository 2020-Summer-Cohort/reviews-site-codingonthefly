      This site is a historical restoration of the original ancient palace
      constructed by the Joseon Empire. The original was destroyed by the
      japanese invasions in 1592-1598. It features historically accurate
      buildings, with numerous workers in historically accurate attire.
    
      King Sejong ruled from 1418-1450. He was most notably known for creating
      the Korean language Hangul. He was very progressive in other manners,
      passing laws to help establish more tourism, scientific discovery, and
      regional stabilization to Korea. <a href="./history.html">#History</a>
