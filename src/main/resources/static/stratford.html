      Stratford is a gorgeous little town just north of the border. If you are
      able to visit during the annual Shakespeare festival you'll be treated to
      a plethora of wonderful stage performances, and if that is not quite your
      style I must recommend the quiet joy of a candied apple while strolling
      the river Avon.
