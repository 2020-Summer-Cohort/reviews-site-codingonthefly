    <h2>Vizcaya Museum and Gardens</h2>
    <p>
      A historical Italian estate first built in 1916 as a private winter
      retreat for American Businessman James Deering, this beautiful villa pays
      tribute to the Italian Renaissance era. On this site tourists can visit a
      Museum that still has its earlier furnishings and artwork intact, as well
      as its beautiful formal gardens. Many tourists say this is one of the best
      bay views in Miami!
