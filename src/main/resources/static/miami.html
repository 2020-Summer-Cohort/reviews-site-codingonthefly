    <p> A historical Italian estate first built in 1916 as a private winter retreat
        for American Businessman James Deering, this beautiful villa pays tribute
        to the Italian Renaissance era. On this site tourists can visit a Museum
        that still has its earlier furnishings and artwork intact, as well as its
        beautiful formal gardens. Many tourists say this is one of the best bay views
        in Miami!
