      The Bruce Peninsula is an astounding area to visit if you enjoy hiking and
      nature. The winding pine forest trails and towering cliffs into crystal
      clear water demand you explore them. After exerting yourself in your
      travels, The Fish And Chip Place serves amazing white-fish tacos(And I
      don't even like fish!)
