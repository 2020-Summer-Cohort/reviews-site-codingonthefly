    <h2>Florence Review</h2>
    <p>
      The city was full of tourist and students. The Galleria dell'Accademia
      housed the Statue of David, which was impressive, but the security team
      does not allow photos. this is very upsetting to most travelers. During
      our visit the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore was hosting a festival
      that filled the streets. The celebration was fun, but there are a few
      safety concerns with pick pickpockets. Be sure to keep your belongings
      safe.

    <h2>Miami Review</h2>
    <p>
      A historical Italian estate first built in 1916 as a private winter 
      retreat for American Businessman James Deering, this beautiful villa 
      pays tribute to the Italian Renaissance era. On this site tourists 
      can visit a Museum that still has its earlier furnishings and artwork 
      intact, as well as its beautiful formal gardens. Many tourists say 
      this is one of the best bay views in Miami! Open to the public, and 
      free of charge! Doesn’t get any better than that. Wynwood Walls was 
      first established and opened in 2009 by well-known art visionary 
      Tony Goldman. This outdoor museum features more than 40 street art 
      murals from some of the leading street artists around the world. If 
      you’re an up-and-coming artist looking for inspiration, this place 
      is a must see!

    <h2>Seoul Review</h2>
    <p>
      This site is a historical restoration of the original ancient palace
      constructed by the Joseon Empire. The original was destroyed by the
      japanese invasions in 1592-1598. It features historically accurate
      buildings, with numerous workers in historically accurate attire. King
      Sejong ruled from 1418-1450. He was most notably known for creating the
      Korean language Hangul. He was very progressive in other manners, passing
      laws to help establish more tourism, scientific discovery, and regional
      stabilization to Korea.
