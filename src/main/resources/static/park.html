    <h2>Bruce Peninsula Review</h2>
    <p>
      The Bruce Peninsula is an astounding area to visit if you enjoy hiking and
      nature. The winding pine forest trails and towering cliffs into crystal
      clear water demand you explore them. After exerting yourself in your
      travels, The Fish And Chip Place serves amazing white-fish tacos(And I
      don’t even like fish!)

    <h2>Cinque-Terre Review</h2>
    <p>
      We got to Cinque Terre and our mouths dropped. It had breath taking views.
      We stumbled on the Cinque Terre Trail after finding that there were three
      ways to travel in between the cities. We ended up taking the hike. It was
      worth it. Our taxi drivers name was Luca. He said we would make it to the
      city next door before the rain. We didn’t make it... Very upset about our
      clothes being wet for dinner.

    <h2>Jeju-Island Review</h2>
    <p>
      These columns are located near the Mangnan Lava Tubes. They are formed by
      volcanic lava being cooled by the ocean water, naturally taking the
      striking column shape. They also have “Black Sand Beaches” nearby, which
      are beachfronts that have black sand, instead of the usual tan. The Museum
      of Glass is exactly what it sounds like. It is a museum that houses
      thousands of blown glass art pieces. Some reference old tales like jack
      and the bean stalk, while others reference Cinderella. Largely most of
      them are scenic views, like trees and flowers.
