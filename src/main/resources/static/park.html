    <h2>Bruce Peninsula Review</h2>
    <p>
        The Bruce Peninsula is an astounding area to visit if you enjoy hiking and
        nature. The winding pine forest trails and towering cliffs into crystal
        clear water demand you explore them. After exerting yourself in your
        travels, The Fish And Chip Place serves amazing white-fish tacos(And I
        don’t even like fish!)

    <h2>Cinque-Terre Review</h2>
    <p>
        We got to Cinque Terre and our mouths dropped. It had breath taking views.
        We stumbled on the Cinque Terre Trail after finding that there were three
        ways to travel in between the cities. We ended up taking the hike. It was worth it.
        Our taxi drivers name was Luca. He said we would make it to the city next door
        before the rain. We didn’t make it... Very upset about our clothes being wet
        for dinner.
